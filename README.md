# Data-analysis-project
Project work for the course "Introduction to Data Sciences" (Tampere University, Spring 2023).
<p> We utilize Python + relevant packages for analysis of data available through public APIs. The analysed data consists of automated measurements carried out by <a href="https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/">Finnish Meteorological Institute</a> (FMI) in Helsinki. The data is related to meteorology and air quality. The data set covers the year 2022.</p>
<p> The goal of the project is to explore connections between variables related to meteorology and those related to air quality. In particular, the following question is addressed: can variables related to weather tell us something about air quality? <p>
NOTE:  The notebook was executed with combination of Visual Studio Code + Python 3.10 + Jupyter notebook under Windows 10.
<p>It may NOT run work with Google Colab or with Anacondas + Jupyter due to memory issues. </p>
<p>Also, at the moment (as of 23.4.2023) it does NOT run under Python 3.11 due to package dependencies (tslearn package).</p>
