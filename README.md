# Data-analysis-project
Project work for course "Introduction to Data Sciences"
<p> This exercise demonstrate some of the features of data analysis using Python + relevant packages. The analysed data consists of automated measurements carried out by <a href="https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/">Finnish Meteorological Institute</a> (FMI) in Helsinki. The data covers the year 2022.</p>
<p> The goal of the exercise is to explore connections between variables related to meteorology and those related to air quality. In particular, the following question is addressed: can variables related to weather tell us something about air quality? <p>

*NOTE:*  The notebook was executed with combination of Visual Studio Code + Python 3.10 + Jupyter notebook under Windows 10.
It may NOT run work with Google Colab or with Anacondas + Jupyter due to memory issues.
Also, at the moment (as of 23.4.2023) it does NOT run under Python 3.11 due to package dependencies (tslearn package).
